# Google Homepage replica #

[Live Demo](https://pataskad.github.io/google-homepage/)

This is the first project in The Odin Projects curriculum in order to further understand HTML semantics and overall structure, including how CSS and JS talk to each other to create efficient applications.  The goal of this project is to build a google homepage look clone (without being a perfectionist).

Additionally, this project is not built with responsiveness in mind via bootstrap or another frontend library due to it not being within the scope of the project outlines, as well as to force myself to learn other techniques to achieve the same goals.
